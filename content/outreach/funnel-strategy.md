### BEACH CLUB VERSION (with GGT)
```
Subject: For your Sunset Rituals — RAV Vast + Live Looping Act

Hi [Venue] team,

I watched your sunset sessions — that's exactly what I do at Relais Villa Porta (Lake Maggiore, 4 years resident).

The format: RAV Vast + percussive guitar + vocals + Ableton. Starts meditative, builds to organic house. 60-90 min sunset-to-night journey.

Credentials: Greece's Got Talent (4 yes votes), Villa Porta resident since 2022.

Here's my sunset set: youtu.be/K7oROUjuLGQ

Open to a trial set for 2026?

## GGT Funneling Best Practices

**The GGT video:**
- ✅ Electric guitar + RAV Vast + stage presence
- ✅ National TV credibility
- ⚠️ Montaggio "TV style" - genera interesse ma non mostra il set completo

**Strategy: GGT as Hook, Not Destination**

1. **In emails:**
   - Mention GGT as TEXT credential ("Greece's Got Talent, 4 yes votes")
   - Link to SEGMENT-SPECIFIC video (not GGT itself)
   - This creates curiosity + shows relevant format

2. **In linktr.ee:**
   ```
   📺 Greece's Got Talent (4 yes votes)
   🌅 Sunset Live Sessions
   🧘 RAV Meditation
   🎵 Spotify
   ```

3. **EPK structure:**
   - Page 1: GGT screenshot + "as seen on national TV"
   - Page 2: Villa Porta residency (credibility)
   - Page 3: Segment-specific content

4. **Follow-up sequence:**
   - Email 1: GGT mention + segment video
   - Email 2: Press coverage (Varese News articles)
   - Email 3: Different video angle

**When to link GGT directly:**
- Festival submissions (they want entertainment)
- Media/press inquiries
- Booking agents looking for "story"

**When to NOT link GGT:**
- Wellness retreats (link Efthymia instead)
- Boutique hotels (link Rocca di Arona instead)
- Any venue where "TV show" might seem unserious
