# Email Draft for Alperen Sümeroğlu

**Subject:** M-shaped dev: jsOM + MCP + live looping musician — Weekly Rewind?

Hi Alperen,

Found ai-clips-maker while building an MCP server for social media automation.

Quick backstory: Italian musician turned coder. Started playing guitar in my bedroom, ended up on Greece's Got Talent. Started scripting Ableton with ClyphX Pro, ended up building AI-enhanced audio tools. The two paths kept intersecting until I stopped treating them as separate.

I call it M-shaped — deep in two verticals:

**Software:**
- **[jsOM](https://github.com/Alemusica/jsOM)** — UI canvas that exports LLM-readable JSON specs (bridging designers and AI agents)
- **[Rememberance](https://github.com/Alemusica/Rememberance)** — DML plate optimizer for vibroacoustic therapy (genetic algo + JAX FEM + modal analysis) - WIP
- **[nico](https://github.com/Alemusica/nico)** — satellite altimetry + AI causal discovery (PCMCI + LLM interpretation)
- **[hierarchical-cognitive-stack](https://github.com/Alemusica/hierarchical-cognitive-stack)** — 4-layer memory architecture for LLMs (scaffolded, lots of R&D ahead)
- Building MCP tools for content automation
- 121 repos, mostly solo deep-dives

**Music:**
- RAV Vast + live looping performer
- Started with ClyphX Pro, brought a scripted set to Denver, now building AI-enhanced plugins
- Greece's Got Talent (4 yes votes)
- 4-year residency at luxury Italian hotel

The M-shaped concept: multiple deep expertise areas, not just T-shaped breadth. Code and music share the same pattern-recognition, improvisation, building from nothing.

I think this intersection could be interesting for Weekly Rewind — a dev who also performs on national TV, using AI tools to scale as a solo creator.

Would love to chat if you think it fits.
