## Pitch (English)

Hi Alperen,

I discovered your Weekly Rewind podcast while researching AI video tools (actually found your ai-clips-maker repo - brilliant work!). Your focus on the intersection of building, traveling, and global innovation really resonates with my own journey.

**My Story in Brief:**

I'm a multi-disciplinary creator building at the intersection of music and AI:

🎵 **Music (as Flutur)**
- Multi-instrumentalist: RAV Vast, guitar, piano, drums + live looping
- Greece's Got Talent participant (4 yes votes)
- Performed in Denver venues, street performances across Europe
- Released on Spotify/Apple Music

💻 **Software (jsOM)**
- Building an AI tool that gives UI designers their place in the LLM era
- Converts visual designs to LLM-readable specs
- Empowering designers in the age of AI-generated code

🌍 **The Connection**
I call it the "M-shaped mind" - deep expertise in two seemingly unrelated fields (music + code) connected by creativity. Both are about patterns, improvisation, and building something from nothing.

**Why Your Podcast?**

Your focus on "coding breakthroughs, innovation insights, startup stories, and lessons from around the world" is exactly my daily life. I've:
- Built software while busking in European plazas
- Found coding inspiration from musical improvisation
- Experienced how being an artist makes me a better developer (and vice versa)

Would love to share this perspective with your audience. I think creators building across disciplines is becoming more common, and there's not enough conversation about it.

Happy to do a quick call or answer any questions first.

Best,
Alessio

   - How musical thinking influences software architecture
   - Improvisation in music vs iterative development

2. **Building While Traveling**
   - Busking in Europe while coding
   - Denver music scene + tech community
   - Remote work as a creator

3. **AI Tools for Creators**
   - Why designers are being left behind
   - jsOM: giving designers agency in the LLM workflow
   - The future of human-AI collaboration in creative work

4. **Authenticity in Building**
   - Building in public across two verticals
   - How music connects with audiences differently than tech
   - Cross-pollination of communities
